            <h2>Form Design Best Practices</h2>
            <p>Notes taken from article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">here.</a></p>

            <br>

            <p>Forms play a vital role in user conversion (getting users to convert from "public" to "consumer"). Simple and short forms are more likely to be completed because they are convenient. A one-column layout offers a downward momentum for users. Dividing a large form into transparent chunks is a good way to decrease cognitive load. Asking easy questions first and higher effort questions later helps to reduce form abandonment. </p>

            <br>

            <p>Guide users through the form in a transparent manner to encourage them to finish the form. This includes clearly indicating which fields are required, having guides for formatting requirements, and labels. Labels close to the input field are more helpful than arbitrary labels. Sizing fields in proportion to their input is a subtle, but effective, way to guide users through a form. Minimizing the extra clicks that come with a dropdown menu will result in faster form completion.</p>

            <h2>Overlay Best Practices</h2>

            <p>Notes taken from article <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">here.</a></p>
            <br>
            <p>
                An overlay, or Lightbox, was created to provide information to users without losing the context of the page. The term Lightbox was coined because of the background page distortion that usually comes with overlays. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you find yourself having many navigation elements in an overlay, it is probably not the time to use an overlay. Overlays should include a brief amount of information to assist users in their flow. Do not use an overlay just to avoid creating another page.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When creating an overlay think about who will be using the overlay, what action is intended, when& where it will appear, and why it needs to be an overlay instead of another page. Thinking about what information is disturbed by the overlay will help to create the best flow. Overlays need an explicit cancel option.

            <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
            <p>Notes taken from article <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">here.</a></p>
            <br>
            <p>Analyzing images is a thought provoking exercise that leads to strong critical thinking skills. The pictures shown in the New York Times article show me how pictures capturing movement or subjects in motion often provide the most information. A grimace or frown are also ways that an expressive face, though a static position, can create intrigue. An image that causes the viewer to ask more questions the more they look at the picture makes for an interactive and engaging experience. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I chose to explore a website that allows AI to predict what 2024 will bring the user based on their astrological sign. It was a very visually interesting program which was both enticing and confusing. Because the creator wanted an aesthetic feeling, there was little guidance to teach users how to use the program. In this case, the visuals brought more questions than answers which was a frustrating experience.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I think a happy medium between choosing images that are visually appealing and explicit, written information is focusing on the conclusions that can be made by looking at visuals. What does the user gain or learn by looking at the image? How does that relate to their conclusions about the site and, arguably more important, their next action?

            <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>

            <img src="images/amer-fort.jpeg" alt="picture of Amer Fort in India" style="float: right; margin: 5px;">
            <p>I am most excited about this picture because of the magnitude of the subject. I am really drawn to the way the light illuminates the structure giving it a sort of ethereal glow. The structure is part of Amer Fort in Jaipur, India and was the home of King Akbar of the Mughal Empire as well as his 3 wives.
            <br>
            The fort is a place of epic architecture, carvings, and history. There are movies about the love story of Akbar and his wife, Jodha. Akbar was a man ahead of his time and aimed to gain knowledge about all peoples. So, he married women from different religions to create allyship with different empires. He married a Christian woman, a Muslim woman, and a Hindu woman (Jodha).  
            <br>
            My project will explore the reasons people from different times, locations, and cultures gather. What is it that makes people want to connect with each other? What do our reasons for gathering say about our needs as humans? This image represents people gathering for safety and the exchange of ideas. They gathered at the fort to protect the King as well as to learn about different cultures. 
            <br>
            The only literal connection I have with this picture is the fact that it is taken in India, but on a deeper level, it represents me re-claiming my Indian identity. As an American born Indian, it is often difficult to connect with my heritage, so every time I visit India it is an emotional and impactful event. Learning about the people before me helps me to discover who I am.

            <img src="images/partner-pic.jpg" alt="picture of Kim" style="float: right; margin: 5px;">
            <p>
                This image, seemingly of Kim, shows her looking at her bag in a candid moment in front of a graffiti wall. The black and white color blocking of her figure creates a stark contrast between the subject and background. I am not able to gather too much information about the story of this photo with little to no context.
                <br>
                I am interested in where this picture was taken. Was Kim purposely posing for the picture or was she just trying to find something in her purse? I really enjoy the contrast between colors in the subject and the background. The vignette in the picture does a great job of drawing focus to Kim while creating depth within the composition.
                <br> 
                It seems like Kim is dressed up for something. I wonder what it is. I am thinking that Kim is posing for the picture so is this image part of a larger photoshoot or was it taken right before an event. Was it taken in the US or in another part of the world? I wonder what her other pictures are of, and how they connect with each other.
